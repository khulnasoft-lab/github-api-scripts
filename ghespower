# Version: 0.1.3

# This script clones a fresh copy of the 'github-api-scripts' repository into a new directory within the install_dir specified below.
# The name of the new directory should be provided as an argument when running this script.
# After cloning the repository, the script will call 'all-the-things.sh' to run a default build of 'github-api-scripts'.
#
# Please note: This script has only been developed/tested against recent MacOS releases and requires additional development time to be ported to other operating systems.
# Current requirements for github-api-scripts itself are available here: https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/github-api-scripts/blob/main/docs/setup.md#prerequisites
# Automation to check for and install these as needed is currently planned
#
# Usage: ./ghespower <new-directory-name>
