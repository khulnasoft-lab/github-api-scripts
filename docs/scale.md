# Scaling and Performance Testing
Whilst The Power is not designed to do scaling/performance/load testing it has some capabilities that can be used for this.

Edit this section in the `.gh-api-example.conf` file and set the values you want:

```
## Default values for scripts that generate many of a resource.
# mostly used for testing things on GHES.
number_of_orgs=3
number_of_repos=3
number_of_teams=3
number_of_branches=10
repo_prefix="gestrepo"
org_prefix="fruitbat"
user_prefix="testusertoad"
team_prefix="testteam"
branch_prefix="testbranch"
file_prefix="testfile"
```

These scripts use connection reuse to speed things up a lot:

```
python-create-many-issues-connection-reuse.py     
python-create-many-users-connection-reuse.py
python-create-many-orgs-connection-reuse.py       
python-create-many-repos-connection-reuse.py
```

The connection pooling scripts are currently the fastest way of creating many resources using The Power. You'll need to install `urllib3` in your python environment:

```
python-create-many-repos-connection-reuse-pool.py 
python-create-many-orgs-connection-reuse-pool.py  
python-create-many-users-connection-reuse-pool.py
```

Pool script taking approx 3 minutes to create 1000 repositories:

If you keep within the GitHub recommendations about [file sizes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) on your GitHub repos and total size of your repo then you'll probably never need to look at performance. If you don't do that then you probably have a host of other problems.
